# Hard Simp

## Our Philosophy
Mastery lies not in complexity, but in the ability to distill it.

This act of simplifying is itself an art - it demands meticulous effort to unravel tangled knots into flowing clarity. Like a parent selflessly guiding their child to outshine them, it is an act of love. Handing down hard-earned wisdom doesn't diminish the parent's journey; it sets the stage for the child to ascend even higher.

_**The simple is never trivial**_. It is the product of dedication and generosity of spirit. The drive to enlighten, not obfuscate.

On the flip side, it's far too easy to muddle clarity. Too often, simplicity is buried beneath convoluted code or cloaked in jargon. And, in a perplexing twist, this obscurity is mistaken for brilliance.

We challenge this perspective. Genius isn't shrouded in intricacies; it clarifies them, casting a light that benefits all, not just a select few.

Our pledge is to this essence of heartfelt simplicity. For us, mastery is about illumination, not mystification. Our guiding star? Clarity for all.

## Why the Name?
hard-simp is a playful nod to our central tenet: Simplicity is hard-won. We believe the labor behind the simple is worth embracing.
